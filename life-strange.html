Life is Strange is a story game of a teenage girl named Maxine "Max" Caulfield, who is studying to be a photographer, in Arcadia Bay, Blackwell's academy. 
The story itself begins in a photography class, where Max sees abnormal vision of a lighthouse being wiped out by a tornado,
and suddenly she is back in the classroom, and it makes her freak out. Let's be honest, who wouldn't freak out by that? After the class, she walks to ladies 
room, to clear her head, after all what just happened. 
A blue, beautiful butterfly flies in the school toilet, and Max decides to take a picture. After the picture, someone comes in to the toilet.
Max hides behind the toilet  cubicles. Blue haired girl came inside the toilet, with a guy named Nathan Prescott, while they were having a fight about something.
Max tries to follow their argument, while staying hidden. Out of nowhere, Nathan takes out a gun, and shoot the blue haired girl to death. Max sees the gun,
Nathan pulling the trigger, and the girl falling on the floor with blood on her clothes. Max is shocked, and she reaches out her hand while screaming, 
and then suddenly everything stops. She suddenly develops an ability to rewind time. She rewinds time to just before the girl and the boy comes in the toilet,
so she has enough time to think, how to save the girl who is her childhood friend, Chloe.
All of what happens in the beginning, starts the story. So many questions, what was the tornado about?
Why did Nathan Prescott shoot Chloe Price? What was he fight about? How can Max rewind time, and how will it affect her life?
The game is insanely beautifully done, and the atmosphere is amazing. If you play it in dark room, with headphones on, I bet you can fall in to it and feel
like you're in the game. 
The plot in the game is amazing, it fucked my brain up in so many ways, that no other game can do that. 
There are 5 episodes in the game, each episode is like levels of awesomeness. The more you play, the better it becomes.
