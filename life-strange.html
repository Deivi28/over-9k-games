Life is Strange is a story game of a teenage girl named Maxine "Max" Caulfield, who is studying to be a photographer, in Arcadia Bay, Blackwell's academy. 
The story itself begins in a photography class, where Max sees abnormal vision of a lighthouse being wiped out by a tornado,
and suddenly she is back in the classroom, and it makes her freak out. Let's be honest, who wouldn't freak out by that? After the class, she walks to ladies 
room, to clear her head, after all what just happened. 
A blue, beautiful butterfly flies in the school toilet, and Max decides to take a picture. After the picture, someone comes in to the toilet.
Max hides behind the toilet  cubicles. Blue haired girl came inside the toilet, with a guy named Nathan Prescott, while they were having a fight about something.
Max tries to follow their argument, while staying hidden. Out of nowhere, Nathan takes out a gun, and shoot the blue haired girl to death. Max sees the gun,
Nathan pulling the trigger, and the girl falling on the floor with blood on her clothes. Max is shocked, and she reaches out her hand while screaming, 
and then suddenly everything stops. She suddenly develops an ability to rewind time. She rewinds time to just before the girl and the boy comes in the toilet,
so she has enough time to think, how to save the girl who is her childhood friend, Chloe.
All of what happens in the beginning, starts the story. So many questions, what was the tornado about?
Why did Nathan Prescott shoot Chloe Price? What was he fight about? How can Max rewind time, and how will it affect her life?
The game is insanely beautifully done, and the atmosphere is amazing. If you play it in dark room, with headphones on, I bet you can fall in to it and feel
like you're in the game. 
The plot in the game is amazing, it fucked my brain up in so many ways, that no other game can do that. 
There are 5 episodes in the game, each episode is like levels of awesomeness. The more you play, the better it becomes.

It is the best video game I have ever played. It has the perfect mixture of everything; supernatural, seriousness, humor and action.
it takes on serious issues and it started to get me emotionally invested in these characters and their lives. I was actually living in the game, I cared about
what was happening around me, and to the people. Life Is Strange is at its best when focusing on the characters. Initially archetypes, each gains depth and 
motivation as the story moves forward. Now that's a sign that the developers had done something very right.
From its opening moment until its final scene plays, Life is Strange is a wonderful, beautiful, touching adventure built upon the friendship of two girls trying
to find their place in the world. This game gives you goosebumps, that is for sure. It was easy for us to get hooked on guiding Max through this exciting time 
in her life, and the ending left our hearts and minds drained and full of emptiness.

The soundtrack -The soundtrack is excellent, too – the acoustic score accompanied by licensed tracks from Mogwai, Amanda Palmer, the Foals and similar. It fits 
perfectly to the atmosphere of the game. The music is gentle and soothing, giving a sense of calmness to the story. 
Although the soundtrack is heavy on the acoustic guitars, and sometimes painfully indie, but I really appreciated that the development team bothered to license
actual tracks for the game. To be honest, I've never felt so overwhelmed by anything, as I felt while playing this game with that soundtrack. 

The graphics - PC would look the best, in my opinion, unless it has poor optimization or no settings. Even though it' not a fantasy game. It does have a lot
of beauty in it.
The graphics also have a pretty cool filter on them, gives them a unique looking style. I think that is where some of the charm comes from. It looks gorgeous
– rendered in a painterly, hyperreal style that seems to effortlessly create memorable moments. Images as simple as Max sitting contemplatively in someone's
kitchen can feel poignant and vulnerable. The graphics use an expressionistic, painterly style that favors colour and emotion over photorealism, with a 
palette taken straight from an angsty teen’s Instagram filters.

The gameplay - Life is Strange is a narrative-heavy adventure game played from a third-person view, with an emphasis on choice and consequence rather than 
conventional gameplay. It’s kind of a hybrid of a TV show and a videogame, released in five episodes over the course of 2015. The time-travel is also central
to the plot, and as is often the case with stories like this, problems emerge.The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action that has 
been done in the game. The player examines and interacts with objects,with puzzle solving in the form of fetch quests and make changes to the environment. 
Collected items before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.The player can explore various locations in the fictional setting of 
Arcadia Bay and communicate with many characters. Once an event is reset, the details provided earlier are permitted to avail themselves in the future.
The voice actors do a great job with what was given to them and bring humanity to their characters. The story guides the player through the levels and it 
doesn't get boring or uninteresting, as said before, the characters have this sense of humanity in them and makes it easy for the player to emotionally
connect with them.

Game time: Around 15 - 20 hours. If you get hooked in the world and characters amongst other things, expect time to pass more. It can be a pretty fast
paced game if you don't slow down and actually engage in the story, which is what makes it so great in the first place. The first episode lasted about 
couple hours and for $5 an episode that's pretty good!

Who is this game for? Life is Strange is a great game for people who likes good storygames and plot. Who appreciate the graphics, and the music. 
Also people who like college drama and Sci -fi and philosophy and photography. I think this would be a great time to buy the game as all episodes 
are out and you can enjoy the whole story.

One advice for someone starting the game? Everything in the game has a purpose. Speaking to another student around the school campus, what you say 
to them, and what you do can affect what happens to you.
For those looking for a lot of gameplay, turn back because this isn't for you. Choices and actions affect the story and you basically just walk around talking
and exploring. The levels are beautifully crafted so it doesn't really get boring. 
Ps. Plants don't usually need a lot of water.
